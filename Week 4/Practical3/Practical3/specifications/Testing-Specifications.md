## Practical 3

### Testing and Coverage

This practical has one task that comprises writing tests to ensure an acceptable level of coverage of the 
implemented code.

In order to check coverage you can use the <samp>**Run | Run with Coverage**</samp> option from the IntelliJ menu.
This option will become available once you have written at least one test.
 
You should familiarise yourself with the code and its operation before testing the solution, and also the original 
specifications if required.  

The only classes not suitable for testing, and therefore no tests will be necessary, are the <samp>**Item**</samp> and 
<samp>**Remind**</samp> (driver) classes.

_**You should aim for a minimum of 85% coverage of all code that is able to be tested.**_

Any questions regarding this can be addressed at the practical session.
